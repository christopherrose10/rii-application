# RII-Application

## Purpose

AS An avid book reader

I WANT to find all books that could not have been written by their authors (published before the authors were 10)

SO THAT I can keep enjoying my favorite authors!

## Deployment
While in the root directory run this command in the terminal (python3 if needed): python -m flask run

Use the endpoint "/notMyBook" to access the list of authors which conatins a list of books they could not have written.
